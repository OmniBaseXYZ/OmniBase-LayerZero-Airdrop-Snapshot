# OmniBase LayerZero Airdrop Snapshot

Welcome to the OmniBase LayerZero Airdrop Snapshot repository. This repository contains the snapshot of addresses and their corresponding coefficients and roles for the LayerZero token distribution. The OmniBase project aims to reward its team, active community members, NFT holders, and ONFT minters/bridge users based on their contributions and engagement with the platform.

The snapshot details are available in the file: [omnibase-layerzero-snapshot.csv](./omnibase-layerzero-snapshot.csv).

## Distribution Plan for LayerZero Token Airdrop

- **Team (team)** - 10%
- **Active Community Members (helper)** - 5%
- **NFT Holders (nft holder)** - 25%
- **ONFT Minters/Bridge Users (nft bridge user)** - 60%

## Purpose of Distribution

1. **Team (team)**  
   To ensure the continuous development, maintenance, and enhancement of the OmniBase platform.

2. **Active Community Members (helper)**  
   To recognize and encourage ongoing community engagement and support.

3. **NFT Holders (nft holder)**  
   To reward stakeholders who believe in and support the OmniBase project.

4. **ONFT Minters/Bridge Users (nft bridge user)**  
   To incentivize participation in cross-chain functionalities, driving growth and adoption of the LayerZero ecosystem.

## Snapshot Details

The snapshot includes the following information for each address:

- **Address**: The Ethereum address of the participant.
- **Coefficient**: The coefficient used to calculate the token allocation for the address. The sum of all coefficients equals 1, meaning that a coefficient of 1 represents 100% of ZRO allocated tokens, a coefficient of 0.1 represents 10% of ZRO allocated tokens, and so on.
- **Role**: The role of the participant in the OmniBase ecosystem (e.g., team, helper, nft holder, nft bridge user).
